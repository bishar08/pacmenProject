# pacmen

For this Excerise, we had to create two buttoms, one that would produce pacmen and the other to start a game.
Create a function that creates pacmen. 
Once created it goes straight to get included to a number of pacmen in an array, which helps to keep track of the position and the velocity of the pocmen.
Also you have make each pacmen bounce off any wall when it hits.
